---

First of all, in the name of the HackUPC team, we’d like to thank you all for wanting to be a mentor. This event would not be complete without you. As a mentor, you will be **helping students work on projects, learn all about a new technology, and come up with creative ideas**. Participants will then have 24 hours to work on any project they choose. HackUPC gives participants the resources, space, and time to create something amazing.

# Who is a mentor?

Mentors are experienced volunteers who want to share their knowledge with new hackers and help them get through different roadblocks. They help new hackers make their dreams a reality by helping them during the event. However, mentors do **not** participate at the hackathon like hackers do and therefore, they can’t submit any project.

# Which are my responsibilities as a mentor?

During the event, we expect mentors to:

- Act as helpers, moving from group to group and helping hackers with any questions or roadblocks they have. However, mentors can’t submit a project or contribute in a team’s project in such a way that a project is mainly his/her work. Their task is to guide and help teams to carry on their own projects.
- Help hackers building their team at the team building event, which takes place at the beginning of the hackathon.
- Be present most of the time. The hackathon starts at 9.00 P.M on Friday and ends
  at 9.00 A.M. on Sunday . It is not necessary to assist the whole event, but we
  encourage everyone to be highly available.
- Check out help requests through our communication channels:
  - Messages from the #mentors Slack channel
  - Requests from the mentors app (Coming soon).

You will receive all the details with respect to these tasks once you get to the hackathon.

## What benefits do I get as a Mentor?

We want you to live a great hackathon experience. As a mentor, you will be able to:

- Assist workshops and tech talks that take place during the event.
- Access to the Lobby, a reserved area for volunteers and mentors where you can hang out and have some rest.
- Have full meals from Friday dinner to Sunday lunch, including all king of snacks and drinks.
- Access to sleeping rooms with air mattresses and showers.
- Get exclusive swag throughout the event: t-shirts, bags, stickers, sponsor merchandising...
