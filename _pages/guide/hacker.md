# Before the event

## :briefcase: What to Bring

- **Valid ID** - Make sure to bring your government-issued or student ID. We will need this in order to check you in. You will also need this if you'd like to check out hardware.
- **QR Invitation code** - This is the QR we sent you when you've confirmed the participation.
- **Laptop, Phone, Chargers, and Other Devices** - Don't forget to bring your chargers and extra batteries for any device you'll be using.
- **Headphones** - If you need to focus it will be easier with them.
- **Comfortable clothes** - We will provide you a T-shirt but for sure you will need more clothes.
- **Towel and toiletry** - We will have showers available and encourage you to use them!
- **Sleeping bag** - If you’re sensitive to cold and plan to sleep, it may be a good option.

We will give out a water bottle, sleeping mask and ear plugs, so you don’t need to bring them with you.

## :round_pushpin: Location

```Edifici A5 del Campus Nord, C/Jordi Girona, 1-3, 08034 Barcelona```

HackUPC will take place in the buildings A3 to A6 of the Campus Nord of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Facultat d’Informàtica de Barcelona). The entrance will be marked with signs so it will be easy for you to find it. 

### :world_map: Directions

#### :airplane: Directly from the airport
Take the L9 line of the metro until the last stop, ```Zona Universitària```. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket from the airport is €5.15.
Another option is taking the train from the station in ```terminal T2 until Sants Estació```, then taking the ```L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial```. This combination will cost you 4.40€, but requires a transfer and takes more time.

# During the event

### :woman::man: In person
Check-in will be open from 4:00 PM to 6:45 PM. While in the queue, please have prepared your ID or the QR we sent you in the mail, as it will help us go quicker! In the check in we will check the rest of the information and we will give you, among other things, **a bracelet that you will have to wear at all times.**

If you arrive later, go to the info desk for late check-in. If you let us know that you’ll arrive late, we’ll have your welcome bag prepared for you! 

We will also have baggage check-in so that you can leave your bags in a safe place.

## :clapper: Opening Ceremony

The opening ceremony will be at the [Vertex](https://goo.gl/maps/vu1vfey5v8u) building at 7:00 PM. Doors will open at 6:30 PM.

Keep in mind that the auditorium has limited seating. For the ones that can not make it, we will **stream the opening ceremony** as well as the closing, on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HackersUPC).

---

## :handshake: Teams

- Join the `#teambuilding` channel on our Slack to meet other hackers and potential team members before the event.
- We will also have a **Team Building** event after dinner on Friday at 9:30PM!

---

## :raised_hand: Rules

The #1 rule is “Be respectful”.
Please read [HackUPC’s code of conduct](https://legal.hackersatupc.org/hackupc/code_of_conduct). We require all hackers to abide by these rules.

---

## :bulb: Hacking

**Hacking is only allowed from 9:00 PM on Friday to 9:00 AM on Sunday!!** You can start planning your project and setting up your work environment (libraries you may use, IDEs you may need…) before that, but no coding. Every project that has been started before the event will be disqualified.

---

## :sos: Need help? Mentors!

During all the weekend we have mentors available for you! If you have any tech-related question or issue, you can contact our mentors through the `#mentors` channel on Slack. Also you can find them around the venue, they will be wearing a white T-Shirt!

This year we have our new **Mentor Lobby**, located in classroom A5105. If you don't find mentors in the hacking rooms, you can go to the Mentor Lobby to try your luck!

---

## :trophy: Project Submissions

Please submit your projects on our [Devpost](https://hackupc-2023.devpost.com) by Sunday 14 at 9:00 AM. Also remember to opt-in for any sponsor prizes that you are eligible for. You can submit early and edit your submission later!

Our judging will be in expo style. You’ll have 3 minutes to demo your project to our judges and show what you've learned and built during the weekend. You should still demo your project even if you’re not finished, as our main criteria don’t include finishing it.

If you have taken part in a sponsor challenge, you will have to do 2 expos: one in the Sponsor's judging room and one at a HackUPC judging room. At HackUPC's judging rooms, it is mandatory to do a code demo, powerpoint presentations and videos are not allowed and your evaluation will be severely undermined by doing a power point presentation.

---

## :woman_office_worker: Sponsor challenges

Remember to opt in the challenges when submitting your project! (By submitting, you automatically opt to the HackUPC prize.) All the challenges will be presented in the opening ceremony as well as the prizes.

Check them during HackUPC in our live page: [live.hackupc.com](https://live.hackupc.com/)

## :computer: Workshops and talks

## :man_juggling: Activities

{% include sections/activities.md %}

---

## :zzz: Sleeping rooms

We will have sleeping rooms available for those hackers who may need a rest at night. They will be open from 12:00 PM to 8:00 AM (both on Friday and on Saturday) and we will have air mattresses so that you don’t have to sleep on the floor. Although we provide sleeping masks and ear plugs, please be respectful of other people’s rest when you enter or exit the rooms.
You will find the sleeping rooms in the A4 building. You can check the maps in our [live page](https://live.hackupc.com/).

## :shower: Showers

Don't forget to take a shower! We will provide various time slots on Saturday and Sunday where you will be able to shower.

Showers will be available from 9:30AM to 11:30AM on Saturday and Sunday, and from 5:00PM to 7:00PM only on Saturday. Please bring your towel and toiletry, as we will not provide it. Although they are gender separated, the showers are shared with other people, so you can bring a swimming suit if you feel uncomfortable.
